Possible Q&A
</summary><div>

- Q: I can't see the launcher's icon in menu\
A: This is beacause of a known electron bug: [https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/3395](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-suite/issues/3395). It's fix is still in progress. 

- Q: Can I add a translation of the program to my language?\
A: Feel free to create a pull request. All translations are on top of .vue files. The format is pretty straight-forward, but if you have problems, you can always contact me via email pointed in the program's info and I will send you clear strings to be translated. 

- Q: A running WebKit examplar just for runnning Touhou Games? U MAD?\
A: This program contains not so much "background" logic and the most of work is building the UI. Nowadays all of ways of building UI are far less perfect than web front-end tools. Dealing with event-based UI technologies is pretty painful and requires more care about details and more time as the result. After all, we all want faster features delivery, right? ðŸ™ƒ
